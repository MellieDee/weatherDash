# Weather Dash
&nbsp;

## Purpose
***
To build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML & CSS.

&nbsp;


## Desired
***
To see the weather outlook for multiple cities as desired.
- Searching for a city presents current and future conditions for a city, and then the city is added to a search history list.
  - From this list, when the previously viewed city button is clicked again, current and future conditions for that city are presented.
- The results include:
  - City Name
  - Current date
  - Icon representing the conditions
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - UV index
    - With color indicating if the UV Index is favorable, moderate or severe

  - 5-day Forecast
    - The 5-day Forecast includes:
      - Date
      - Icon representing the conditions
      - Temperature
      - Wind speed
